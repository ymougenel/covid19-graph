# Covid19 Graph

Covid19 graph is a humble project, aiming at displaying updated data regarding  the disease.

## Disclaimer

I do not have any professional experience regarding the DataViz field, therefore **no conclusive deduction** can be made out of the graphs.

The corona virus is a deadly threat that can not be to lightly! Therefore any **data comparative deduction should be using professional tools**, such as:

## Contribute

Well, thank you, but please don't: many [great projects](https://github.blog/2020-03-23-open-collaboration-on-covid-19/) are currently fighting the virus and need your help more than I do.

## Development

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deployment

Run `docker-compose up --build` to run a nginx server.

_*Note:*_ The server file structure is quite touchy, since I struggle to make it work behind a Ha-proxy Load balancer.
